## Presentation 

### Criteria for Oral Presentation 
1.) Presentation is well-designed and well-ordered <br>
2.) Presentation aids are clear and easily understood <br>
3.) Presentation is by all partners <br>
4.) Presentation covers the essentials (listed below) <br> 
5.) Presentation includes a [typical program](https://github.com/andrewcp54/prolang-finalproject/blob/master/eliza_basic.clj) for that language <br> 

### Software Evaluation 
| Difficulty | Question |
|-----------:|:---------|
| Not Set    | In what paradigm(s) does this language reside? |
| Not Set    | Who is the intended audience? Do the authors reach that audience? |
| Not Set    | What is the environment like? Is an editor provided? What is the compiler like? What is the exception handling like? |
| Not Set    | What is the documentation like (including interactive documentation)? Is this implementation dependent, or part of the language design, or can you tell? |
| Not Set    | How easy is it to debug the program? Does the program give adequate error messages?  |
| Not Set    | Evaluation of key language principles - security, readability, writability, simplicity, uniformity, efficiency, expressiveness, etc. - if they apply  |
| Not Set    | Which data types are built into the programming language (if any)? Are user defined types allowed? Are dynamic variables allowed? |
| Not Set    | Did you like working with the software? |
| Not Set    | If you had to suggest a use for it, what would it be? |
| Not Set    | Is there any research written on the software? What does it say? Do you agree or disagree? |
| Not Set    | Is there anything this language does extremely well? Anything it does poorly? |
| Not Set    | What hardware is required to run the software? |
| Not Set    | How much does it cost? |
